# QXGraph

QXGraph provides functions for solving graph theoretic problems related to the task of 
slicing and contracting a tensor network.

  - Useful algorithms for analysing a tensor network's line graph are described in [Treewidth Algorithms](@ref)
  - Some QXGraph functions make use of a LabeledGraph struct described in [Labeled Graphs](@ref)
